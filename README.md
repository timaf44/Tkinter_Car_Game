# Tkinter_Car_Game
Arcade car game where the player's car has to dodge NPC cars and collect coins. Each coin counts as a score. If the player's car hits the NPC cars, the game ends, and the player must type in their name to be saved to the leaderboard.

During gameplay, pressing ESC opens the pause menu, allowing the player to save the game, quit, or continue. Additionally, pressing 'B' activates a boss key, displaying an image and pausing the game.

The game features a main menu with 5 buttons:

1.Start: Initiates the game.
2.Load: Loads a saved game.
3.Leaderboard: Displays the leaderboard.
4.Customize: Allows players to assign different keys for movement.
5.Quit: Exits the game.
